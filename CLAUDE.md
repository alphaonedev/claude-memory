# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Required Reading at Session Start (AI agents)

Before proposing any change to this repository, load the following into context:

- [`docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md) — the eight-phase
  workflow every AI session must follow (recall → plan → branch → implement → gates →
  self-review → PR → handoff).
- [`docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GOVERNANCE.md`](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GOVERNANCE.md) — authority
  classes (Trivial / Standard / Sensitive / Restricted), attribution rules, security
  policy, memory governance, and the hard prohibitions you must never violate.
- [`docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](docs/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md) — code, test,
  security, and release standards.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contributor procedures.

### Loading project memory at session start

The mechanical guarantee is the SessionStart hook documented in
[`docs/integrations/claude-code.md`](docs/integrations/claude-code.md).
Install it once; every fresh Claude Code session boots with relevant
memory context already in the system prompt — no model proactivity
required. See the full agent matrix in
[`docs/integrations/README.md`](docs/integrations/README.md).

If the hook is not installed (cold-start fallback), call
`memory_session_start` followed by `memory_recall <task topic>` before
responding. Text directives are best-effort; the hook is the load-bearing
mechanism. See [issue #487](https://github.com/alphaonedev/ai-memory-mcp/issues/487)
for the RCA.

Default namespace for this repo is `ai-memory-mcp`.

Every commit you author must end with a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the model.
Every PR you open must include the **AI involvement** section described in
[`AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` §8.2](docs/AI_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md).

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
cargo build                    # Debug build
cargo build --release          # Release build (thin LTO, stripped)

# All four gates must pass before PR submission:
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::all -D clippy::pedantic
AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1 cargo test
cargo audit

# Run a single test
AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1 cargo test test_name

# Benchmarks
cargo bench --bench recall
```

`AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1` prevents loading user config which may trigger embedder/LLM initialization during tests.

## Dogfooding release branches

Every `release/v0.6.x.y` branch should be dogfooded by the maintainer for at least 24h before tag-cut so any migration / capability / wire-format regression surfaces in real use, not just CI. The script that does this on this node:

```bash
scripts/dogfood-rebuild.sh
```

What it does (idempotent — safe to re-run after every commit):
1. `cargo build --release`
2. Backs up the live MCP DB to `/tmp/ai-memory-dogfood-test-<ts>.db`
3. Dry-runs migrations against the backup (proves v17→v18→v19 etc. round-trip cleanly on real data)
4. Re-points `/opt/homebrew/bin/ai-memory` → `target/release/ai-memory` (via `brew unlink` + symlink)
5. Lists running MCP processes that need a Claude Code restart to pick up the new binary

What it does NOT do:
- Touch the live DB (migrations only run when an actual ai-memory process opens it on the next MCP restart)
- Kill the running MCP (would self-DOS the in-flight Claude Code session)
- Bump `Cargo.toml` version (that's a tag-cut concern)

Reverting to the brew-managed binary: `brew link --overwrite ai-memory`.

## Reproducing the v0.7.0 recursive-learning primitive

`scripts/reproduce-recursive-learning.sh` is the self-contained end-to-end
demo for the v0.7.0 recursive-learning add-on (issue #655, Tasks 1-4
landed; Tasks 5-8 in flight on `feat/v0.7.0-recursive-learning`). It
builds the release binary, creates a fresh sqlite DB under
`.local-runs/repro-recursive-learning-<timestamp>/` (honoring the
project no-`/tmp` HARD RULE), inserts 3 sample memories, drives
`memory_reflect` over MCP stdio JSON-RPC up to the default depth cap
(3), and demonstrates the refusal at depth=4 with a clearly-formatted
`REFLECTION_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` verdict block. Idempotent (each run uses
a fresh timestamped subdir).

```bash
scripts/reproduce-recursive-learning.sh
# Set REPRO_KEEP_DB=1 to retain the demo DB for inspection after the run.
```

The full conceptual primer lives at `docs/RECURSIVE_LEARNING.md`; the
release-notes intro lives under `docs/v0.7.0/release-notes.md`
§"Substrate-native recursive refinement".

## Architecture

**ai-memory** is a Rust-based persistent memory system exposing three interfaces over a shared SQLite database layer:

1. **MCP Server** (`src/mcp/`) — stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 with 63 tools at full profile (5 default per v0.6.4 `--profile core`) + 2 prompts
2. **HTTP API** (`src/handlers.rs`) — Axum REST server on port 9077, 50 endpoints at `/api/v1/`
3. **CLI** (`src/main.rs`) — clap-based, 40 subcommands with optional `--json` output

All three interfaces share the same database (`src/db.rs`) and validation (`src/validate.rs`) layers. Shared state is `Arc<Mutex<(Connection, PathBuf, ResolvedTtl, bool)>>` — a single SQLite connection protected by a mutex. Lock contention is the bottleneck under concurrent HTTP + MCP load.

### Key Modules

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `main.rs` | CLI parsing, daemon setup (Axum + GC scheduler), command dispatch |
| `mcp.rs` | MCP server: stdin/stdout JSON-RPC loop, tool definitions |
| `db.rs` | All SQLite operations: CRUD, FTS5 queries, recall scoring, GC, schema migrations |
| `handlers.rs` | HTTP request handlers (Axum extractors), error sanitization |
| `models.rs` | Core data structures: Memory (15 fields), MemoryLink, request/response types |
| `validate.rs` | Input validation for all write paths |
| `config.rs` | Feature tier system (keyword/semantic/smart/autonomous), TTL config |
| `reranker.rs` | Hybrid recall: blends semantic (cosine) + keyword (BM25-like FTS5) scores |
| `embeddings.rs` | HuggingFace model loading, vector generation, cosine similarity |
| `hnsw.rs` | In-memory HNSW vector index for approximate nearest-neighbor search |
| `llm.rs` | LLM integration via Ollama: query expansion, auto-tagging, contradiction detection |
| `toon.rs` | TOON format: token-efficient JSON alternative (40-60% smaller) |
| `mine.rs` | Conversation import from Claude/ChatGPT/Slack exports |
| `errors.rs` | ApiError, MemoryError enum, HTTP status mapping |
| `color.rs` | ANSI color output for CLI |

### Data Model

- **Memory**: 15-field struct with id, tier (short/mid/long), namespace, title, content, tags, priority (1-10), confidence (0.0-1.0), source, metadata (JSON), timestamps
- **MemoryLink**: Typed directional relationships (related_to, supersedes, contradicts, derived_from)
- **Tiers**: short (6h TTL), mid (7d TTL), long (permanent)
- **Feature tiers**: keyword (FTS5 only) → semantic (MiniLM embeddings) → smart (Ollama) → autonomous (cross-encoder reranking)

### Recall Pipeline

Recall is multi-stage and **never read-only** — every recall mutates the database:

1. **FTS5 keyword search** — fuzzy OR query, scored by `fts.rank + priority*0.5 + access_count*0.1 + confidence*2.0 + tier_bonus + recency_factor`
2. **Semantic search** — cosine similarity via HNSW index (or linear scan fallback), threshold >0.2 (relaxed from 0.3 in v0.6.2 Patch 2 after scenario-18 caught a miss at 0.25-0.29 cosine for legitimately-related content)
3. **Adaptive blending** — `final = semantic_weight * cosine + (1 - semantic_weight) * norm_fts`. Semantic weight varies 0.50 (short content ≤500 chars) → 0.15 (long content ≥5000 chars) because embeddings lose information on long text
4. **Touch operations** (atomic) — increment `access_count`, extend TTL (1h short / 1d mid), auto-promote mid→long at 5 accesses, increment priority every 10 accesses

### Upsert Behavior

Storing a memory with the same `(title, namespace)` updates the existing one. Tier is never downgraded (takes max). Expiry is only cleared if the new memory is `long`-tier.

### Database

SQLite with WAL mode, FTS5 virtual table for full-text search, schema version v7 with automated migrations. Archive table preserves GC'd memories for restoration. FTS is kept in sync via INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers. GC runs every 30 minutes; expired memories are archived before deletion when `archive_on_gc=true` (default).

### Environment Variables

- `AI_MEMORY_DB` — database path override
- `AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1` — skip loading `~/.config/ai-memory/config.toml`
- `AI_MEMORY_AGENT_ID` — default `agent_id` for memories this process writes (see §Agent Identity below)
- `RUST_LOG` — tracing filter (e.g. `RUST_LOG=ai_memory=debug`)

Config precedence: CLI flags > config file > compiled defaults.

### Agent Identity (NHI) — `metadata.agent_id`

Every stored memory carries `metadata.agent_id` — a best-effort Non-Human Identity
marker. See design discussion on issue #148. **agent_id is a *claimed* identity,
not an *attested* one** — do not use it for security decisions without pairing
with agent registration (Task 1.3, upcoming).

**Resolution precedence (CLI and MCP):**

1. Explicit value from caller (`--agent-id` flag, MCP `agent_id` tool param, or
   `metadata.agent_id` embedded in an MCP store request)
2. `AI_MEMORY_AGENT_ID` environment variable
3. (MCP only) Value captured from `initialize.clientInfo.name` →
   `ai:<client>@<hostname>:pid-<pid>`
4. `host:<hostname>:pid-<pid>-<uuid8>` (stable per-process)
5. `anonymous:pid-<pid>-<uuid8>` (fallback if hostname unavailable)

**HTTP daemon mode** is multi-tenant, so there is no process-level default:

1. `agent_id` field in `POST /api/v1/memories` body
2. `X-Agent-Id` request header
3. Per-request `anonymous:req-<uuid8>` (logged at WARN)

**Validation:** `^[A-Za-z0-9_\-:@./]{1,128}$` — permits prefixed forms
(`ai:`, `host:`, `anonymous:`), `@` scope separator, `/` for future SPIFFE-style
ids. Rejects whitespace, null bytes, control chars, shell metacharacters.

**Immutability:** Once a memory is stored, `metadata.agent_id` is preserved across
update, dedup (UPSERT), MCP `memory_update`, HTTP `PUT /memories/{id}`, import,
sync, and consolidate. Preservation is enforced at both caller layer
(`identity::preserve_agent_id`) and SQL layer (`json_set` CASE clauses in
`db::insert` and `db::insert_if_newer`).

**Filter by agent_id:** `list` and `search` accept `--agent-id <id>` (CLI), the
`agent_id` property (MCP tool), or `?agent_id=<id>` (HTTP query param).

**Special metadata keys produced by the system** (do not overwrite):

- `imported_from_agent_id` — original claim preserved when `ai-memory import`
  restamps agent_id with caller's id (absent when `--trust-source` is passed)
- `consolidated_from_agents` — array of source authors, preserved on
  `memory_consolidate` (the consolidator's id becomes `agent_id`)
- `mined_from` — source format tag (`claude` / `chatgpt` / `slack`) stamped by
  `ai-memory mine` alongside the caller's `agent_id`

**Defaults that leak:** The fallback `host:<hostname>:pid-…` exposes hostname and
PID. When writing memories to a shared or upstream database, set `--agent-id` or
`AI_MEMORY_AGENT_ID` to something scrubbed (an opaque identifier, `alice`, etc.).
Tracking issue: #198.

## Adding New Functionality

**New CLI command**: Add variant to `Command` enum → define `Args` struct → add dispatch case in `main()` → implement `cmd_*` handler taking `&Path` (db) + args.

**New MCP tool**: Add JSON definition in `tool_definitions()` → add match arm in the dispatch block → implement handler taking `&Connection` + params → return `Result<Value>`.

**New HTTP endpoint**: Add route in `main.rs` router → implement handler in `handlers.rs` using `Db` extractor.

## Code Style

- `cargo fmt` required. All code formatted with rustfmt.
- Zero warnings under `clippy::pedantic`.
- Copyright header on all source files: `// Copyright 2026 AlphaOne LLC` + `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`
- PRs target `develop` branch, not `main`. `main` is production releases only.
- Commit format: `<type>: <summary>` (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf)

## Prime directive (operator-set, 2026-05-17)

> This is a **prime directive** — it overrides any general-purpose
> framing of "non-blocking", "trend-line", or "surface-level" issues.
> It applies to every agent that touches this repository.

**The rule.** If you find or identify an issue, OPEN AN ISSUE,
TRACK THE ISSUE, FIX THE ISSUE. Every issue gets fixed. That is
the standard.

**No surface-level dismissals.** There is no such thing as a
"surface-level" issue. Do not classify findings as "non-blocking",
"docs-drift", "trend-line", "MCP-coverage-gap", or any framing
that would let the issue rot in a queue. Every gap is a defect.
Every defect is fixed.

**World-class only.** We are driving toward perfection. The
ai-memory codebase is now substantial (70 MCP tools, 50 HTTP
endpoints, 40 CLI subcommands, tens of thousands of lines of
Rust); the architectural North Star is long-term code-base
manageability so the codebase lasts for a very long time.

**Mechanics.**
- Discovery → tracker entry → fix → close is one non-divisible
  workflow. The discoverer is responsible for all three steps
  OR for explicitly handing off each step to a named queue/PR
  with a tracker reference.
- Every `auto-filed-by-agent` issue MUST have a "Proposed fix"
  section with concrete file paths + line counts.
- For each test-campaign phase: a separate "findings" memory
  enumerating EVERY anomaly. All findings reach the issue
  tracker before the next phase starts.
- Documentation drift between code behavior and docstrings is a
  real defect. File AND fix the docs (or fix the behavior so it
  matches the docs).
- The phrases "non-blocking", "trend-line gap", and
  "surface-level" are banned in finding writeups.

**Three-wave refactor mandate (pre-v0.7.0 release).** Three
sequenced waves of refactor + review work must complete BEFORE
v0.7.0 ships. None is skippable. All three are pre-release.
See tasks #16 → #17 → #18 → #19 (FINAL MISSION docs+pages
drift) for the current execution state.

**Six strategic high-level lanes (operator-set 2026-05-17 pm-v3).**
The canonical lane index lives in memory
`c413ac25-912c-4ffb-b939-5c19a201c25a` (namespace
`_v070_strategic_tracking`; supersedes earlier `afd38b34-...` and
`b1109500-...`). Every session boot should load it.

| # | Lane | Task |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | Bugs/issues — fix everything | #22 |
| 2 | Code line coverage | #23 |
| 3 | Full-spectrum testing (NHI + A2A 100% regression + net-new + DO hive) | #24 |
| 4 | Code refactoring (3-wave mandate) | #25 |
| 5 | Documentation drift — 100% remediation | #26 |
| 6 | GitHub Pages website redesign (3 audiences + 3 AI-NHI brass tacks) | #27 → issue #832 |

Lane 3 testing tracks:
- Track A: NHI playbook P0-P11 + verdict — #7 (P0-P2 done)
- Track B: A2A 4-domain IronClaw, 100% regression + net-new — #8
- Track C: Postgres + Apache AGE on 192.168.50.1 — #9
- Track D: Cross-node integration (.100 ↔ .1) — #10
- **Track E1: DO CPU agent hive — sustained, low-TCO, xAI Grok 4.3 API** — #28 → issue #833 (**operator $-approval gated**)
- **Track E2: AWS GPU burst hive — vLLM + Llama-3.1-8B self-hosted, 2-3 day window, $200 cap** — #29 → issue #834 (**operator $-approval gated**)

E1 + E2 are complementary, not competing. E1 = "anyone can run on commodity hardware" (C-Level audience case study); E2 = "GPU-grade enterprise performance" (SME-engineering audience case study). Both demonstrate the same D1-D5 swarm/hive primitives; Lane 6 website uses both.

All 6 lanes pre-release. None skippable. Cross-lane discipline: Lane 1 is
the meta-lane (every other lane's findings land there); Lane 3
re-runs on the Wave-3 post-refactor binary; Lane 5 final sweep is
post-refactor; Lane 6 can run in parallel with Lane 4; Track E
captures feed Lane 6 case-study content.

**Provenance.** Live memory `5d703efe-273b-4c84-8f40-ceb97b55d71e`
in namespace `global/policies` is the canonical version of this
directive and supersedes the earlier
`71ecce23-611b-4984-962d-d37c4309f261`.

## Commit & push policy (project override of global default)

> This policy **overrides** Claude Code's global default ("NEVER commit unless
> the user explicitly asks"). Two days of uncommitted work is bad engineering;
> the loss of work on a local-only edit graph is a real failure mode. The
> override below distinguishes **committing** (local, recoverable, low blast
> radius) from **pushing** (shared-system write, higher blast radius) so each
> can have its own discipline.

**Commit autonomously when work crosses a logical checkpoint.** No need to
ask first. Specifically commit when ANY of these become true:

- A feature lands and all four gates (`cargo fmt --check`, clippy `-D warnings
  -D clippy::all -D clippy::pedantic`, `AI_MEMORY_NO_CONFIG=1 cargo test`,
  `cargo audit`) are green.
- A fix lands and the regression test that pins it passes.
- A patch series completes (e.g., L1-L15 patch batch, a 4-lane audit fix
  series, a multi-issue fold-in).
- A doc-only change is self-contained and the surrounding sections are not
  in mid-rewrite (`grep -n "TODO\|XXX\|TBD" <file>` in your scope is clean).
- An hour of focused work has accumulated and the working tree is at a clean
  point (gates pass).
- The agent is about to start a substantial in-flight task that could
  conflict with the current dirty state (commit-before-pivot).

**Group commits by intent.** Don't dump the whole working tree into one
commit. Reasonable groupings (in this repo's recent ship history):

- `feat(...)` per issue or per feature
- `fix(...)` per bug or per finding (#318 / #355 / L14 / G5 / etc.)
- `chore(deps)` for `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock` together
- `chore(tests)` for test-scaffold updates that follow a struct-field
  addition
- `docs(...)` per doc surface (CHANGELOG separate from ROADMAP separate
  from release-notes when they touch different audiences)
- `infra(...)` for Dockerfile + entrypoint changes

**Stage explicit paths**, not `git add -A` or `git add .`. Prevents accidental
inclusion of `.env`, credentials, large binaries, or work-in-progress
sibling files the user didn't intend to land yet. The bash command this
file already documents (`git add <specific>` then `git commit`) holds.

**Use a HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages.** Every commit ends with
the `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the model (matches the discipline in
the existing AI Developer Workflow doc).

### When to ASK before committing

Ask the operator first when ANY of these apply:

- Mass-deletion (more than ~5 tracked files about to be `git rm`-ed) that
  isn't the result of an explicit "delete X" instruction.
- The diff touches a file the operator has been actively hand-editing
  in the same session (concurrent-edit risk; check `git diff` against
  the most recent system-reminder of the file).
- The commit would land secrets-looking content (anything matching
  `password|secret|key|token|cred` patterns in the diff that isn't a
  test fixture or doc).
- The commit would re-introduce reverted code (check `git log -p`
  against the relevant region).
- The cert/CI signal is currently RED and the commit doesn't itself
  close the failure.

### Pushing — separate, higher bar

**Pushing requires explicit operator authorization.** Each push to a shared
remote branch is a write to an external system that may trigger CI, sync
to a PR diff, or notify reviewers. Different blast radius from local
commits. Default discipline:

- Local commits accumulate freely under the rules above.
- Push to `origin/<topic-branch>` (e.g., `round-2-fixes`,
  `feat/...`) when the operator says so, or when the operator
  authorizes the agent to push at agent's discretion for a defined
  scope (e.g., "push everything you commit on this branch today").
- **Never force-push** without explicit operator authorization, ever.
- **Never push to `main` directly**, even with authorization to push to
  other branches. `main` is production-tag-only.
- **Never push to `develop`** without operator authorization specific to
  `develop`, since `develop` is the integration branch.

### Rationale

This policy is the project's response to two empirical failure modes:

1. **The default-NEVER-commit rule** produced 80-file working trees with
   ~7,000 lines of uncommitted code after multi-day sessions, where a
   power loss or container crash would have lost the work. That is
   unacceptable engineering.
2. **A blanket "always push" policy** would be reckless — pushing kicks
   off CI, lands diffs on open PRs, and notifies reviewers. The separation
   above lets the agent be safe (commit often) while keeping high-blast-
   radius actions (push, force-push, push-to-main) under operator
   control.

The default-flexible-commit / explicit-push split is the cleaner discipline.

## No agent-created files under /tmp, /var/tmp, /private/tmp, or any tmpfs (project hard rule)

> This is a **project hard rule**, not a preference. It overrides any
> tool, shell, or library default that would land scratch files on a
> tmpfs path. It applies to every agent that touches this repository.

**The rule.** Agents working in this repository MUST NOT create files
under any of the following paths, ever:

- `/tmp/...`
- `/var/tmp/...`
- `/private/tmp/...` (the macOS realpath of `/tmp`)
- any other tmpfs-backed path the host exposes

This covers, at minimum: bash one-liner output redirects (`> /tmp/log`),
`heredoc` write-throughs, log captures, `script(1)` typescripts,
container-test artifacts, capability JSON dumps, ad-hoc fixtures,
benchmark output, dogfood-rebuild backup files, and any
`mktemp`/`mktempfile` call where the path is not explicitly overridden
to a project-local location. The rule applies to files that the agent
itself creates; it does NOT apply to files OS tooling creates beneath
the agent (e.g., compiler `/var/folders/...` scratch, the Claude Code
harness's own session cache).

**Allowed scratch location.** All agent-created scratch lives under:

```
/Users/fate/v07/v07-fixes/.local-runs/
```

This directory is gitignored (see `.gitignore`). It is the canonical
home for: log captures from background `cargo` runs, container-test
output dumps, ad-hoc verification scripts, throwaway fixture JSON,
benchmark roll-ups, and similar transient artifacts. Sub-organize
freely (`.local-runs/r8-cert/`, `.local-runs/2026-05-12/`, etc.) —
the directory has no enforced internal structure.

If a tool or third-party script defaults to `/tmp`, pass it an
explicit `--output-dir` / `TMPDIR=$PWD/.local-runs` / equivalent.
If it has no such override, write the output to a project-local
path first and post-process it instead.

**Why this is a hard rule.** During the v0.7.0 cert sequence
(2026-05-11/05-12), accumulated agent scratch on `/private/tmp`
across multiple agents (~30+ logs/scripts/typescripts) contributed to
a full-disk ENOSPC failure that halted in-flight work, forced a
`colima delete -f` to recover, and lost the Plan C container fleet.
The root cause was not any single file — it was the absence of an
enforced project-local scratch convention. This rule closes that
gap. Future agents inherit the convention by reading this file at
session start.

**Discipline.** Zero strikes from here forward. A single violation
is grounds for the agent to self-revert the offending command, move
the file under `.local-runs/`, and update its working memory with
the redirect so the mistake doesn't repeat in-session. The operator
will be informed if a violation occurs so the convention can be
hardened further (e.g., a pre-tool-use hook).

**Cleanup.** `.local-runs/` is intentionally NOT auto-cleaned. Each
agent is expected to delete its own scratch when a task finishes
green and the artifacts are no longer needed for the handoff memory.
A long-lived `.local-runs/` is a smell — flag it in the handoff.
